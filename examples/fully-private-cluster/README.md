# Fully Private Amazon EKS Cluster

This examples demonstrates how to deploy an Amazon EKS cluster that is deployed on the AWS Cloud, but doesn't have outbound internet access. For that your cluster must pull images from a container registry that's in your VPC, and also must have endpoint private access enabled. This is required for nodes to register with the cluster endpoint.

Please see this [document](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/private-clusters.html) for more details on configuring fully private EKS Clusters.

For fully Private EKS clusters requires the following VPC endpoints to be created to communicate with AWS services. This example solution will provide these endpoints if you choose to create VPC. If you are using an existing VPC then you may need to ensure these endpoints are created.

    com.amazonaws.region.aps-workspaces            - For AWS Managed Prometheus Workspace
    com.amazonaws.region.ssm                       - Secrets Management
    com.amazonaws.region.ec2
    com.amazonaws.region.ecr.api
    com.amazonaws.region.ecr.dkr
    com.amazonaws.region.logs                       – For CloudWatch Logs
    com.amazonaws.region.sts                        – If using AWS Fargate or IAM roles for service accounts
    com.amazonaws.region.elasticloadbalancing       – If using Application Load Balancers
    com.amazonaws.region.autoscaling                – If using Cluster Autoscaler
    com.amazonaws.region.s3                         – Creates S3 gateway

## Prerequisites:

Ensure that you have the following tools installed locally:

1. [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
2. [kubectl](https://Kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
3. [terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

## Deploy

Since this is a Fully Private Amazon EKS Cluster, make sure that you'll have access to the Amazon VPC where the cluster will be deployed, otherwise you won't be able to access it.

For this example, we'll be using an Amazon Cloud9 environment to run Terraform and manage the Amazon EKS Cluster. The Cloud9 environment is already running in the Default VPC, we'll setup a VPC peering between the Default and the Cluster VPC in order to have access to the Kubernetes API and manage our EKS Cluster.


To provision this example:

```sh
terraform init
terraform apply -target module.vpc -target module.vpc_endpoints -target module.vpc_endpoints_sg
terraform apply -target module.eks
terraform apply
```

Enter `yes` at command prompt to apply

## Validate

The following command will update the `kubeconfig` on your local machine and allow you to interact with your EKS Cluster using `kubectl` to validate the CoreDNS deployment for Fargate.

1. Check the Terraform provided Output, to update your `kubeconfig`

```hcl
Apply complete! Resources: 63 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

configure_kubectl = "aws eks --region us-west-2 update-kubeconfig --name fully-private-cluster"
```

2. Run `update-kubeconfig` command, using the Terraform provided Output, replace with your `$AWS_REGION` and your `$CLUSTER_NAME` variables.

```sh
aws eks --region <$AWS_REGION> update-kubeconfig --name <$CLUSTER_NAME>
```

3. Test by listing Nodes in in the Cluster.

```sh
kubectl get nodes
NAME                                        STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
ip-10-0-19-90.us-west-2.compute.internal    Ready    <none>   8m34s   v1.26.2-eks-a59e1f0
ip-10-0-44-110.us-west-2.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   8m36s   v1.26.2-eks-a59e1f0
ip-10-0-9-147.us-west-2.compute.internal    Ready    <none>   8m35s   v1.26.2-eks-a59e1f0
```

4. Test by listing all the Pods running currently. All the Pods should reach a status of `Running` after approximately 60 seconds:

```sh
kubectl $ kubectl get pods -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kube-system   aws-node-jvn9x             1/1     Running   0          7m42s
kube-system   aws-node-mnjlf             1/1     Running   0          7m45s
kube-system   aws-node-q458h             1/1     Running   0          7m49s
kube-system   coredns-6c45d94f67-495rr   1/1     Running   0          14m
kube-system   coredns-6c45d94f67-5c8tc   1/1     Running   0          14m
kube-system   kube-proxy-47wfh           1/1     Running   0          8m32s
kube-system   kube-proxy-f6chz           1/1     Running   0          8m30s
kube-system   kube-proxy-xcfkc           1/1     Running   0          8m31s
```

## Destroy

To teardown and remove the resources created in this example:

```sh
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
